# Random notes

* Bug: when a preset is added or deleted, the camera is not updated, but the listed preset in the combobox changes. This can lead to confusion. Need to find a better way.
* There is no way to change the name of the config file.
* Need to have absolute config file and the port name as mandatory command parameters.
* Reset button?
* Reboot button?
* Drop down menu?
